Shapes with turtle functions
by Sarah vincent

# About this code
Within trinket.io/turtle, I created this code to draw shapes in different colors, and positions on the output screen. This code uses functions to create polygons with different numbers of sides and different sizes as the variables. I also changed colors using r, g, b variables to include shades of my favorite colors instead of the standard shades. 

The polygon function can be used to make different polygons. Just enter the number of sides for the polygon (Ex: 4 for a square, or 3 for a triangle) and enter the size of each side to make a larger or smaller shape. 

Enjoy!
